# Tiny Habits

## Tiny - Habits by BJ Fogg Video
**Question 1**:
The most interesting idea I obtained from this video  was how starting with a tiny action, like one push-up, makes building habits easy.

**Question 2**:
You can use B = MAP by choosing habits that donâ€™t need much motivation, are simple to do, and are linked to something you already do.
M = Motivation (how much you want to do it)
A = Ability (how easy it is to do)
P = Prompt (what reminds you to do it)

**Question 3**:
Celebrating after doing a habit makes you feel good, so your brain wants to do it again.

**Question 4**:
The most interesting idea in the video is that if you improve just a little bit every day, those small changes add up to something big over time.

## Book Summary of Atomic Habits
**Question 5**:
The book says lasting habits come from changing your identity, like seeing yourself as a runner instead of just trying to run.

**Question 6**:
The book says that to make a habit easier, you should reduce friction, like keeping things ready and starting with small steps.

**Question 7**:
To make a habit harder, increase friction, like removing temptations or making it less convenient.


## Reflection 

**Question 8**: 
I would like to start exercising. I will start by doing 10 pushups as soon as I wake up. To make it more attractive, I would buy a pair of dumbbells or resistance bands.
Also, I would reward myself by listening to my favorite music.

**Question 9**:
I would like to eliminate junk food from my diet. To make it easy, I would completely stop buying any junk food. Also, I would store healthy foods
in my fridge. To make it unsatisfying, I would give away 100 rupees to a friend every time I have junk food.
